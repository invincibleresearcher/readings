3~5. Opic question
What are some topics you talk about when you are with your 
family members or friends? Why do those things interest or 
concern you?

Children' education is always the most common topic when I talked with 
my wife. Korean parents are very passionate about the children's education
and because we live in a very competitive school district in Seoul, we 
should always take care of everything about children's education such as 
what kind of private tutoring is needed at this moment, which academic 
institutes are the best in our village for each subject, such as 
writing and math. Also, because it's very expensive to support all 
children's education activities, our financial plan such as how much
we earn and we can afford to children's education each month is also 
our common topic as well.

But when I met my friends, we usually talk a lot about stocks and real
estates. I think that money is always important topic in our lives and
it's funny to say but, I usually discuss how to make money with 
my friends and how to spend money with my wife. Currently, the prices of
every assets including real estate, stocks and even cryptocurrency 
have risen significantly over the years and it's very hard to predict
about the next market rallies. So, we sometimes chat together on such
issues and recommend each other about which stock will grow in future, or
which stock which asset is good to buy or when we should sell such assets,
though there is no financial experts in our group. Personally, I don't
trust my friends' opinion one hundred percent, but I enjoy chatting on 
such financial topics with my friends to increase my knowledge scope.
