3. When people talk about travelling, what are the main issues or concerns 
they typically raise or discuss? What has caused these concerns? What is 
being done to address these concerns for the future?

I think that each person would have their own problems and concerns 
when it comes to travelling. In my case, the biggest concerns are
the travel cost and the safety. The safety that I mean includes all
safety issues from any issue from stranger danger to foods and
accommodation hygiene issues.

First, in my case, I do not enjoy travelling alone, but love to
travel with my family, meaning I have to pay for everything that
my family spend and consume during the travel. So, if all travel 
expenses are beyond my budget, I would be in big trouble with 
my financial plan and I could not afford to support my family with 
abundance. In the worst case, my financial plan which I already set up
correctly would be modified again, which is the issue that I want to
avoid the most in my life.

Also, my children are very sensitive to the cleanliness of the 
hotel room where we stay during travel. If the toilet and shower 
facilities look dirty, my children would never use them during
travel and my children would be annoyed day and night throughout
the trip. Also, I want to make sure that the food we are eating is
always safe. If not, my family could get food poisoning and I 
don't want my family to stay in a hospital during all vacation.
Also, I heard that a lot of crimes occur during travel 
and most importantly, I would not like to get in trouble with anything
related with crimes happening in a strange place with strangers.

Once again, the travel expense and the safety are my biggest concerns
regarding with travel.
