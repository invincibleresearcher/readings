1. Describe exactly what you did during the last vacation that 
you spent at home. Give me a description from the first to the 
last day of all the people you saw and everything that you did.

Well, I remember that my last vacation at home was last winter.
In my company, it's our employees mandatory to use all of their 
given paid vacations before new year comes, but because I had
been very busy with developing new products last year, I had 
still more than 7 paid vacation days at last December that should 
be used before the next January. So, after all major work items
completed, I finally could take seven days off from work to take
some rest with my family at home around the Christmas season.

When I stay home, my wife usually wants me to look after our 
second baby while our first kid studies not to be interrupted by our
second baby. So, during the last vacation at home, she also ordered me 
to stay with our second baby in the for of a favor while she took care 
of our first kid, which was exactly what I expected before the vacation
started. So, what I did mostly at home during the last vacation was 
taking care of my second child, reading books together, playing console
games together or playing dolls with her. When I felt tired from
playing with her, if my wife also agreed on how much I played, I
could have my own time with sleeping even at the day.

But I couldn't enjoy such my own time more than one hour. When
my wife approved my first daughter to have some rest after finishing her 
homework and studies, she also came to wake me up to play together. 
Sometimes, she asked me to play boards games such as monopoly 
or asked me to teach how to play a Chinese chess game, which is called
Janggi. 

When we all got tired and wanted to eat some foods, I also ordered
some delivery foods for my kids and so, the food delivery guys were
the only strangers that I met during my last vacation at home. 
So, I spend my last vacation at home with my family not to violate
the company's rules regarding employee's annual paid vacation days
and there was no strangers but some food delivery guys that I met
during the vacation.
