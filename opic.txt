My country, South Korea, has many neighboring countries around Korea
Peninsula, but especially I would like to share some of my opinions about 
the relationship changes between my country and China. 

When the Korean war broke out in nineteen fifty, China intervenes in the war
as our enemy's allies to support the communist regime in North Korea. At that
time, because Cold war just started, there were endless conflicts between
democratic governments and communist government all over the world. So even
the war was over after signing up the peace treaty later, my country and 
China just had remained as enemies and there was no diplomatic activities, 
no businesses allowed between two countries.

But after the cold war was over in nineteen nineties, two countries started
to open the diplomatic channels, such as deploying embassies in each countries 
and having regular summit meetings. Since then, two countries have made a lot 
of the political efforts together to build new relationships in almost every areas 
from economics to culture and sports and so on. At that time, I was an elementary 
student and I remember that many Korean companies started to expand their 
businesses into China market and also many Chinese products such as agricultural 
products began to be imported into Korean markets.
So, after this period and in two thousands, two countries have worked very
closely together for improving their businesses more and now China becomes
the second or third largest trading country to South Korea. Also, both
countries are tied very closely for resolving North Korea's issues and
now nobody cannot deny that China is very important business and 
political partner to Korean people. 

But everything is not good between two countries and I recently noticed that
there's some movements in our people's attitude against Chinese government
when it comes to the worst air pollution in Korea. Many people in my country
believe that a lot of air pollution come from China and there are many
scientific evinces supporting this, but Chinese government never admit their
fault on this issue. To maintain good relationship between two countries, I 
just wish that China should change their attitude and look on this issue 
very carefully.
