In my opinion, Sokcho is one of the most unique places in our country.
Sokcho is located in the east coast in Kangwon Province and this city is
also very near from many famous mountains such as Seok-Ark mountain.
Whether it's superstition or fun, many people in my country make our wishes while 
watching the sunrise. Because Seok-Ark mountain has many beautiful places 
for the sunrise, people in my country really love to travel to Seok-Ark mountain 
to see the sunrise. For the visitors in Seok-Ark, Sokcho city provides various
convenient facilities and there are a lot of hotels to stay during the visit 
of Seo-Ark mountain.

Also, Sokcho is so famous for raw fish and crab foods, because it has its own 
sea port and various fish markets near the sea port. A lot of people visit
these markets because freshly caught fishes arrive in the market everyday
and people are able to buy such best quality raw fishes with very cheap prices.
If you like eating raw fishes and crab foods, Sokcho is the best place to be visited.
It will be fun but you should also watch out the rip-off when trying to buy fishes 
in the local markets.

Also, Sokcho has beautiful beach with very clean sands. Korea has 
sea on its three sides and there are a lot of beaches in our country.
But the beach in this city differs a lot from others and what make it so special 
is that there exists a lake just next to the beaches and this lakes was made 
naturally by wind and sands a long time ago. Because of the geographically 
uniqueness in this place, there is also very famous poem about this place 
which one old poet wrote after visiting this place. He wrote that he found 
five different moon here. First moon is in the sky, the second and the third 
moon is reflected on the see and the lake. The fourth moon from the glass of 
liquor he holds and the last but most beautiful moon is reflected on the 
eyes of his lover.

Because Sokcho has very unusual beach and is very near from Seok-Ark mountin,
I think that this city is so unique in my country.


3. opic question
Tell me about some news you heard or watched related to severe weather 
or a natural disaster.

When I was in USA, I sometimes visited New York city for meeting my wife and
one day, I also went to my wife's apartment at New York city for helping her
move. But after arriving at LaGuardia airport, I took a taxi to my 
wife's apartment and the taxi driver told me that a hurricane Irene 
might hit the city and we might reconsider our moving schedule because 
of the possibility of an evacuation order by the city mayor.

At that time, because we were from Korea and never experienced a hurricane
before, my wife and I just decided to stay home while watching news from TV
and the internet to re-schedule our moving plan. From the news, we realized
that the power of Irene hurricane was so strong that a lot of houses in the east
coast were already destroyed and the hurricane was getting stronger and was 
heading towards New York city. On the top of that, we also heard from news 
that many people already stocked up on foods and supplies to prepare for 
emergency. After hearing such news, my wife and I also went out for buying
some foods and found out that almost every mart around my wife's apartment 
were already closed. So, we called a taxi and asked the driver to go to any 
mart where we could buy foods and he drove to a grocery store near his home
and we finally could buy some foods and milk at the end.

At night, electricity finally went out in her apartment and what we could do
was just reading the hurricane news using our phones while staying in the
darkness. After one day, I also heard from the news that New York city was 
safe, but some areas in other states were flooded severely and many people lost 
their houses and cars or even families. In some news, the disaster experts 
also estimated that hurricane damage caused massive losses in some insurance 
companies and the stock prices of those companies would get worse or some insurance 
companies would go bankrupted in the worst case.

As far as I remember, hurricane Irene was the worst disaster we experienced
and watched and I felt very sorry after hearing many people's losses about 
family death and their properties.
