Tell me about the time when it took the longest to get to somewhere. 
Was it a holiday or was it when you had a trip abroad? How did you feel 
during the travel?

It was when I first went to USA for studying and it almost took one day
to get the Detroit airport from Incheon airport with two transit flights.
Because I wanted to save my money for the flight ticket, I choose the 
cheapest one, but the problem was that I needed to wait at Chicago airport
more than six hours to transfer to a new flight to arrive at Detroit. 
Because of jet lag, I felt very tired and almost slept one day after
getting my house at the university.

A. Have you had a problem while traveling on a public transportation? 
You might have forgotten your wallet or lost something there. Or, the bust 
or subway had problems.

I remember our family trip to Singapore two year ago. During the Korean
thanksgiving seasons, I traveled to Singapore with my wife's family to 
visit the business partners of my wife's family business and to stay at
some resort places. I have two children. During my study at the states, 
my first child was born there and because she has both US and Korean 
citizenship, I didn't make her Korean passport but instead I just used 
her US passport when I returned to Korea after finishing my study.

So, I thought that I could use her us passport again for our Singapore
travel again. I didn't know that using us passport was a problem until
all our family got the airport and issued the flight tickets at the 
airline counter. When I showed my first kid's us passport to a 
airline employee at the counter, he explained we cannot use us passport
for a round-trip from Korea because she hold two different citizenships
together. I and my wife were unaware that such laws exist in our country
for Korean people who hold more than two different citizenship and
we thought that it was too late to get on the board before the 
flight departure. But, fortunately, the airline employee helped us 
very kindly so that we could finally issue a short-term Korean passport 
at the foreign affairs office at the airport. It didn't take less than 
fifteen minutes and because of the airline employee' help, all of our family 
finally got on the board on time.

Once again, I had a problem with using us passport for my first kid 
when I traveled with my family to Singapore, but many people helped us
at the airport to get Korean passport for my kid very shortly and we 
finally got on the board without missing the flight departure.


B. What kind of problems have you had while driving yourself? If you never 
drove a car, just tell me what you think you might have had.

I would like to share some episodes that I had during driving at Seoul
without any navigation system at all. As you know, Seoul is a very big and
complex city and even though I've been grown up in Seoul, I don't know
very well about which roads to take to get to my destination or which
roads usually have less traffic. So, I always rely on the GPS system 
working in my phone and my car together.

But one day, when I returned to home after visiting my mother at night,
I just figured out that my phone's battery power is almost zero and even
worse, the navigation system in the dashboard suddenly lost the GPS signal
and started not working correctly. So, I had to read the road signs very
carefully to get home at right direction without any help of navigation
guidance. During driving, I first needed to find which roads to take 
to get on East Expressway in Seoul and then which exit to take from
the express way to get Yongdong Bridge over Han river. But some road
signs were incorrect and I couldn't find a way to get on East Expressway
and it took almost two hours to arrive at Yongdong Bridge. In some areas
in Seoul, the roads are very complicatedly connected to each other and when
there is no navigation system at all, we need to be very careful not to get 
lost in such areas.

So, I had such difficult time when driving in Seoul without any navigation
and before driving in Seoul, I always check first whether my phone is 
charged fully to use navigation app.
