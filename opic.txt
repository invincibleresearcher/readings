3.  Tell me about the last time you bought a new piece of clothing.
What did you need and where did you find it?
Were there any challenges or problems? Give me all the details.

When I bought my clothes last time, I bought a couple of T-shirts, 
some loose pants. For shirts and pants, my favorite brand
is Tommy Hilfiger, because there are various clothes with loose styles.
I prefer to wear my clothes usually bigger than my size, though my size is not
small, and I usually like to wear such loose clothes when I go for work. During my 
work, I need to work more than 10 hours eveyday and I feel very uncomfortable
when I wear tight clothes. So, I usually wear loose-fitting clothes to work
more comfortably at work and I can choose various options for such styles when I 
visit a Tommy Hilfiger store.

Also, I remember getting another shirt online without checking the size 
carefully. Buying clothes online can be cheaper than in the stores, but
I think that there is really no way to check the size correctly.
When I first checked the size by only seeing its photo in my mobile app, 
I thought that I could fit me, but it turned out that the shirt was too tight and 
too short and it did not look good on me. So, I called the store to check
whether the bigger size was in the stock and sent it back to get an exchange for 
bigger one.

So, these were the last time I bought a piece of clothing and some
problems that I had.
