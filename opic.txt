Regarding the importance of vacations, I very strongly agree with
the opinion that vacation is truly essential for people's health and family
happiness but also for maintaining the work efficiency in the company.
Let's take a close example in our daily lives to see what would happen 
if your parents or your wife or your husband have to work more than 10 
hours everyday without any vacation during one year. Let's assume 
that your husband or wife have work hard without any vacation.
Then, your spouse may not want to talk with you after getting home from
work and he or she would become very sensitive from work stress and get
annoyed all time. And even more your spouse would not play with children.
So, every member in your family would become unhappy. So, I believe that 
working without having any rest during vacation always harms the healthful 
marriage life and family happiness.

Also, I think that sickness always come to us when we get stress and 
there is no way to get rid of it.
Here is another example using my case. My company compensates extra 
money when I work during weekends or public holidays or when I don't spend 
sufficient paid vacation days which is given every year. 
So, I can get more salaries and may become much richer when I work during 
all holidays and without any vacation. But if I would get sick and 
have serious disease such as cancer and severe depression, what would 
happen to my children and my wife ? The extra money that I earn 
would not save my family from their sorrow. So, I think that having
vacation regularly keeps both our bodies and mind from getting sick 
from stress.

Finally, I also support this opinion in terms of work efficiency. 
You can work hard during very short period of time, a week or two weeks. 
But what if someone or your boss asks you to work very hard more than 
two months ? Under such circumstance, many people may experience extreme 
tiredness or get depressed so hard and finally feel not being able 
to work any more.
Everyone may have similar experience having such burnout in the workplaces.
So, working for a company is almost like running a marathon race and you
cannot win such a long race without having vacations. 

So, I think vacations are very important when we think about our 
happiness, physical and mental health and work efficiency.
