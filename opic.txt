1. Tell me about a time when you or someone you know did something
new to become healthier. Maybe it was playing a sport or eating something
healthy food. Tell me about the change in details.

Personally, I was too surprised with my regular medical check-up 
last year and I heard from my doctor that my body has been signaling some 
bad symptoms about my health such as fatness, high blood pressure, some medical
index for high degree of stress and etc. So I made up my mind to do 
everything that I can do for improving my health this year.

To become healthier, I think that eating healthy foods and having regular 
eating habit is most import things I need to keep in my daily life.
Before, when I was busy and missed my dinner time at my work place,
I sometimes enjoyed eating foods at night using delivery services,
which turned out to be very bad about my health. So, I am now trying
to eat every meal regularly and most importantly, not to eat anything at 
all at night.

Also, in the cafeteria in my work place, there are various meal options we
can select. In the past, my favorite choice was usually noodles and fried
foods and I am now trying to eat various types of healthy foods instead,
such as salads, vegetables, non-fried chicken, fish and beefs as well. 

Also, one of my family has been farming in the empty land in his local 
properties as hobby he is growing vegetables without any chemicals. 
He also shares his harvest with us and because of him, I am also trying
to eat organic vegetables for free.

This is pretty much everything I can do for my health these days.
