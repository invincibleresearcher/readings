C. What means of transportation do you like the most? If you don't like 
buses or subways, you can talk about bicycles or walking.

The subway is always my favorite transportation when my wife uses my
car and my car is not available when I need or when I visit some downtown
areas in Seoul where there are not enough parking lots. When I was in my
childhood, there were only few lines of subways in Seoul and there was no
subway station near my home, the bus was only public transportation that I
used. But when I used buses at that time, the bus schedules were very 
irregular, it was very difficult to arrive at my destination on time. 
Usually, I arrived too late or too early. So, not to be late, 
I needed to take on the bus much earlier, and I couldn't avoid wasting 
my time on the streets.

But today we have many subway lines almost ten lines in Seoul and now 
almost every village in Seoul has at least one closest subway station. 
Also, the subway schedules are very regular and tightly scheduled so that 
the next subway always come less than ten minutes when you miss the previous
subway. So, we can arrive at our destination on time and we don't need to 
leave earlier. So for those people who take are of punctuality most, I
always recommend to use the subway, not the bus. Also, unlike the New York 
subways, the Seoul subways are very clean and safe and the last subways in 
Seoul usually operate until night.

Once again, there are subway stations all over Seoul, and it is very 
convenient to use the subway in Seoul. So, subway is my favorite 
transportation.

3. Opic question
Tell me about a transportation problem that you once faced. Tell me 
everything about what happened and what you did to deal with the 
situation.

I would like to share some episodes that I experienced few years ago 
because of my car's battery. On every Saturday, my family usually go
outside to enjoy our weekend. Even though we don't have any special
schedule, just going outside and eating lunch and dinners at different 
restaurants and visiting some famous places is our Saturday routine.

One Saturday, after waking up in the morning, I also drove outside with
my family and first visited a hospital to get a medicine prescription 
for my child's cold. After getting prescription, when I tried to turn
on my car, I just figured out that the car engine made s no sound at all
and I failed to turn on my car. First time, I thought that maybe the 
turn-on button itself had some mechanical problems, but after several
tries, I finally figured out that the button had no problem at all, but 
the car battery has very little power to turn on the car. 

So, I called the insurance and soon after, the car maintenance guy
arrived at the parking lot and charged the battery sufficiently to turn 
on my car. I thought that he fixed the issues and I drove again to the
bookstore to buy some books that my daughters like. After buying all
book and returning to my car, my car failed to start again and I called
the insurance and asked to send the car maintenance engineer again.
The second engineer was much more professional and after inspecting 
several things, he concluded that the car battery was dead and recharging
the battery may temporarily start the car once, but replacing the battery
was the right solution. So, I called again the insurance to bring
new car battery and finally I could replace the dead battery with
the new one.

I asked my wife about any suspicious activities she did and she finally
confessed that she turned on the car lights more than two hours while
turning the car ignition switch off few days ago and I let her know that 
such things may make the car battery dead.

Once again, because my car battery was dead, I had a transportation 
problem on one Saturday and fixed the problem by replacing the dead
battery with new one.
