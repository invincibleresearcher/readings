2.  What do you do when you go shopping?
Where do you go and what do you look for?
Tell me about your typical shopping habits in detail

I usually go to the outlet malls when I want to buy clothes
for my children, because there are many fun places to play together with my
children inside the outlet malls. While my wife is shopping for our children's clothes, 
I take care of two children and try to find where are the best places to play
with my children. That could be a playroom and some empty space for children
to play catch and run. When my children get bored, I bring them to the
ice-cream store and go to the places for play again. I usually repeat this
again and again until my wife is finally done shopping.

So, when I go shopping, the most important thing that I am looking for
is the places for playing with my children. No matter how good the facilities
in the outlet malls are, if there is no places for children to play, I do not
visit.

After visiting many shopping places including various department stores, 
I finally found the best place for shopping for my family, the lotte outlet
mall located in PAJU city in Korea. There are some rides for children and 
some dinosaur shows held every two hours while a lot of brand stores are located
inside the mall. So, there are a lot of options for me to play with my
children while waiting for my wife's shopping.
