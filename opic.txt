3. I'd like you to think about a specific historic event that has 
affected the relationship between your country and one of its 
neighboring nations. It could be a treaty signed between two countries, 
a cultural event or the visit of other country's minister or president. 
Tell me in detail about everything that happened.

After the independence from Japan, I think that North Korea has always played
an important role in most of historic events in my country sometimes as a 
partner, but most times as an enemy. Among many events, I would like to
share how Cheonan warship sinking accident affected the relationship between
South and North Korea.

In the early two thousands, Seoul tried new diplomatic experiments against
North Korea, which is called Sunshine policy, the name was from famous 
Aesop's Fables. The government in my country at that time thought that the most 
effective way for unification of two Koreas is not from power games or fights, but from 
great tolerance to each other. So, what the government did was to improve
the relationship between two countries by investing a lot of money into 
North Korea and by building various infrastructures in their lands for 
North Korea's economic recovery no matter how much North Korea provoked us.
So, at that time, we could go sightseeing in North Korea.

But about ten years ago, suddenly, our warship, the ship's name is Cheonnam
was sunk and many soldiers died in the sea while patrolling the west sea
of Korea Peninsula. At the first time, we didn't know why such a disaster 
happened and what caused the death of our soldiers, but after several 
investigations done by many countries including USA, CHINA, RUSSIA and JAPAN,
we finally concluded that the only cause of the sinking is an attack and the 
prime suspect is North Korea.

Soon after, all diplomatic dialogues were shut down and our country put great
pressure on North Korea by all means of diplomatic sanctions to make North Korea
admit this crime, though this country has never admit it as their fault. So
from this historical event, we are no longer able to visit North Korea for 
sightseeing and all diplomatic activities as part of sunshine policy were 
stopped.

Once again, in my opinion, Cheonnam warship attack was the biggest 
historical event affecting the relationship between South and North Korea the
most.
