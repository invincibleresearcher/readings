3. How does internet usage vary among people of different age groups?
How do they use the internet differently? Please discuss this matter 
in more detail

I agree on the opinion that people use the internet differently 
depending on their ages. First, children use the internet differently 
from their parents. I have observed many cases such that children are 
very much exposed to the video contents from youtube before 
going to the elementary schools. I guess that the main reason for this is 
simply because there are a lot of youtube channels for kids and such 
channels always upload different contents regarding toys, dolls and games 
almost every week. Such contents are enough to attract children's 
attention and children mainly use their parents' phones or smart tv
to access the youtube contents on the internet and yet they are not 
usually allowed to have their own devices for using the internet.

When children grow up and start to go to the school, they are also required
to register online classes and have to watch online classes every day. 
Because of the corona virus, the administration in our country changed 
most of school classes into online classes and it's now mandatory for 
students to watch such online classes and submit their assignment into 
the education portal system.  So, I guess that today students use 
the internet mostly to attend online classes and to communicate 
the school teachers via the education web sites. From this time, 
children may start using their own devices with large screen such as
laptops or desktops for online classes and they no longer ask their
parents to borrow parents' devices for their internet usage.

For adults who work for companies, I recently found a new pattern 
of the internet usage by them. Now, many companies in our country
ask their employees to work from home because of corona virus spread and
most employees should be able to login in their companies' intra-network
systems to remotely connect the company computers from home. For security
reasons, companies like samsung do not allow such connection from mobile
devices, but only from employee's PCs, which all network transactions are
monitored in real-time by the company's security apps. So, during working
hours, most of adults who work for companies have to stay online on such
secure internet connection for remote work.

Again, the internet usage differs a lot depending on people's age.
