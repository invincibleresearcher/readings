Maybe it was something impressive, unusual, humorous or meaningful for you.
What did you notice about it? What made it special?

I remember the first online PC game that I had played and watched 
together with my friends on the net is the one of the most memorable 
events in my internet history. The game is starcraft.
In my university, all students should live in the dormitories and 
when we had free times, we enjoyed playing PC games in our dormitories.
But, when I was a freshman, playing games in our dormitories was 
very inconvenient. At that time, there was no network facilities 
installed in our dormitories and even more there was no online 
games released in our country. So, because we couldn't play together 
games just like what we play online games today, instead we usually gathered 
in one of our friends' room and took turns for playing games one by one. 
I still believe that our university provided excellent environments for 
studying, but it was very poor environment for playing games first time.

But, in nineteen ninety nine when I was a 2nd year student in my university,
we heard that starcraft was released in Korea, and it was possible to play 
with our friends in the game as allies or enemies if all the players are 
connected to the same game server. Soon after the game release news, 
my university decided to install network facilities in our dorms to improve
study environments. But unfortunately, we used our network resources for
online starcraft games, which was exactly opposite to our university's 
hope. During days and nights, my friends & I had played games or sometimes
just observe the other friends' games by joining the server online to improve 
our game skills. It was great fun and very amazing to play games together 
in different places while chatting each other online for sharing game 
strategies simultaneously. Although, there were some students who became
so addicted to starcraft and got F credits and failed in some classes, the
first time when I played starcraft games online with my university friends
is still quite memorable.
