Tell me about when you really liked the weather. How was the weather 
then? What were you doing? Who were you with?

I liked summer a lot when I was in my childhood because I had
longer vacation than the vacation in winter and I could swim in the
swimming pool. When I was a kid, there were only outdoor swimming 
pools in my village and the swimming pools were open only in summer.
So, I always looked forward to summer vacations and my family enjoyed
swimming together.

A. Tell me about places you like in your country. What are some 
geographic features of those places? 
-->
Because of corona virus, recently I changed my favorite place
from Seoul to Paju where I can find many places which are a 
little less crowded compared to the places in Seoul. As far as 
I know, Paju is very unusual city in my country and it has many 
geographical features. 

First, Paju is one of the cities very near to North Korea and 
is located in the northernmost of South Korea. So, this city
shares a river and borderlines with North Korea and there
exist a DMZ peace park in the northern area of this city where
a peace treaty between North Korea and my country was signed after
the end of Korean War. Because of these geographical features, 
Paju is relatively more quiet and less complex than Seoul. 
Also, many politicians from South Korea and our ally countries 
also have visited Paju first to arrive at DMZ. So, because of 
our long history with North Korea and DMZ, Paju is sometimes considered
as a city of peace and freedom in my country.

Paju is also very famous for the display business. In Paju, LG 
corporation has invested a lot of money into building several display 
factories and now all high-tech LG display products are manufactured 
in Paju and are exported to other countries all over the world. So,
if you own LG TV at your home, then you can say that the TV display 
panel in your TV came from Paju. When LG started building its display 
factories, a lot of people including LG employees and employees of its 
second and third vendor companies needed to stay in this city, but Paju 
had very poor infrastructure and nobody wanted to live there at that time. 
So, the government announced to build a new city in Paju, which is called 
UnJung city and many people in Paju now live in the new city which has very 
good infrastructure for living including many modern apartments and 
education and medical facilities.

Once again, Paju has various geographical features related with North Korea
and today this city has become so famous for its display business.
