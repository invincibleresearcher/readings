1. Talk about a country that is geographically similar to your 
country. What are the changes the country has gone through in 
recent years?

I think that North Korea is the most similar to our country geographically,
because both countries are located at the same Peninsula, Korea Peninsula
which is located at tip of East Asia. They were actually from the same 
and united kingdom a century ago. Two countries have almost same areas 
and our country and North Korea also shares some of the coastlines 
together, although two countries are still at a war truce.

Recently, we could hear about many news about North Korea because this
country has been again facing many economic difficulties and hardships 
under strong economic sanctions by the united states, and many people in
this country have starved to death. We don't know exactly how many
people in this country are suffering from famine, because there is
no way to investigate these issues with no manipulation at all without 
any intervention from the North Korea's dictatorship.

After a new governments in South Korea was established few years ago,
North Korea tried to open the diplomatic dialogue again to the united
states at the Trump administration. Maybe, the country's young leader,
Kim JongEun thought that he could save his people from famine after few
nice talks with President Trump. But again, since Kim doesn't want 
to give up the country's nuclear weapon development programs, all dialogue 
channels for nuclear talk were shut down and Washington still maintains 
strong economic sanctions on North Korea even after Biden won the 
presidential election in the states.

Once again, North Korea is very similar to our country geographically and 
is our neighboring country. This country recently tried to change their 
diplomatic posture to resolve the country's economic sanction, but it 
failed due to the relentless pursuit of nuclear weapon programs.
