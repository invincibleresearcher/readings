1. Fashion styles are always changing.
Tell me about the kinds of clothes that were popular when you were younger.

I think that Korean people have always been very interested in fashion.
So, the fashion trend in Korea has been changing every year and the fashion trend 
in the past was quite different from the today's trend.
When I was a kid, I remember that the adults at that time usually wore hippie-style 
clothes and boots and even men also preferred long hairs.
I also heard from my parents that Elvis Presley was top idol and most of
men just tried to imitate everything that Elvis wore and acted in TV shows.

When I was a teenager, I remember that the fashion tread in our country 
changed a lot and people in Korea no longer liked hippie-style clothes.
Especially, young students during my teenage loved to watch japanese animation
and movies and we were just crazy about everything about the fashion styles
shown in the japanese animation and movies. Also, there were many fashion 
magazines dealing with japanese fashion and those magazines contained a lot 
of photos about how young japanese people got dressed on the toyko 
downtown streets.

Today, after Korean pop culture has become popular worldwide, people are
becoming more interested in the clothes and other fashion items which 
korean pop stars wear. So, I think that Korean pop stars are leading
the today's fashion trends and this is a great change against the fashion
trend in the past.
