I think that today people mostly concern about their privacy and security issues when it
comes to the internet. But things were different in the past. When the internet 
was used first time in nineteen eighties, I heard that there were various 
network protocols developed for research purposes, and only few students and 
researchers at universities used the internet for sharing their research 
information. Since the network size was very small and there was no malicious 
users at that time, the main issues using the internet was not the personal 
securities, but the performance issues such as long end to end latency between 
two end users and slow network throughputs.

However, soon after around nineteen nineties and the early two thousands, 
the network technologies had advanced a lot and the first version of web browser, 
which was called navigator, was developed. This made a lot of normal people started 
to use the internet easily not only for their studies, but also for their hobbies 
just like reading newspapers and watching TV. After the web browser development, there was no 
hurdles for accessing the internet itself, but finding the correct information
on the web became another problem since a lot of information were spread so widely 
and in a very unstructured way. So, people at that time concerned a lot about how 
to find the correct web pages which mostly match the user's keywords. So, as 
results, various web search engines such as lycos, yahoo and google were developed 
and people started to use them widely and today such web search engine becomes
the most essential part of our internet browser.

Today, I can say that we are just living in the world of information, and in the
connected world over the internet and a lot of our personal information are stored 
in the cloud systems over the network and thus people become much more sensitive 
about their personal securities and how to protect their privacy against hackers or 
malicious softwares. Recently, there have been serious incidents regarding icloud photo 
leak issues. I also heard that some hackers were able to access the apple 
icloud accounts of several hollowoods celebrities and their photos containing secret 
privacy were shared on the internet. So, from the icloud leak cases, people today 
become much more aware of their privacy and security issues.

Once again, as the internet has advanced and changed over the years, people's
concerns also have varied a lot.
