2. Vocabulary
A.  Tell me about the things you complain about when 
you are with your friends. How do you feel when you share 
how you feel with them? 
-->
When I meet my friends these days, I usually complain about the 
high tax rate on my salary and real estate properties that I own.
Even though my company gives my salary more and I get more 
incentive and performance bonus compared to all moneys that 
I got last year, I find that there is no much difference in my gross
income this year after all taxes and public insurance are paid. 
Some people may be uncomfortable when talking about taxes, but my
friends are very good listeners and we've known each other more than
twenty years, all of us understand each other's situation very well.
When I talk with my friends, I feel less stressed and feel more at ease
and confident.

B. Tell me about your best friend. Have long have you known 
each other? What does he or she look like and what do you like most 
about that friend? 
-->
My best friend, XXX and I have known each other for more than 
twenty years. We first met when we were in the third year of high
school. To be honest, he's not physically attractive, but I don't care
such things because such things are not important at all in our 
friendships. He is just a normal guy with the average height and
weight, but he is a very considerate and thoughtful person who always 
pays attention to people around him in troubles. So, I like his personality
and such attitude towards people most. I always respect him as a friend
or a teacher because I could learn a lot from him.

C. Do you like chatting on the phone with your friends or 
family? About how much time do you spend on chatting? What 
application do you use? 
-->
Personally, I don't like to chat on the phone with my friends and my wife,
because I don't have much topics to talk about on the phone. When
we need to discuss something, we prefer to use Kakaotok, a famous 
messenger app in our country and we usually leave very short 
messages on the messenger without expecting quick response. So, I don't 
spend much time with my friends and my wife on the phone and it 
usually takes less than fifteen minutes on the phones.

But when I communicate with my mon, I always use the phone and 
become very talkative. I always keep asking what she needs and what
kind of dramas and books she watches and reads recently, or what she
will eat for dinner. Because she lives alone and in a different city,
almost everything she's doing and how she feels is my top priority and 
our conversation usually takes more than half an hour.
