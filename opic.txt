--> Recently, I watched very interesting stories from medias that there 
are some people who are doing intermittent fasting for weight loss and
health purpose and they even claim that doing fasting regularly can improve 
our health condition. Because it is said that people can lose more
than 20 kg of weight in a month by doing fasting routinely and they can even
maintain that weight for more than 2 years, I think that everyone is now 
talking a lot about intermittent fasting to lose weight.

Because of the popularity of intermittent fasting, I also learned some basic
rules from the internet. There exist various versions of intermittent fasting,
but one common key strategy for losing weight is maintaining regular period 
of patterns of eating foods with planned calories and short-term fasts which 
should be no food consumption at all.

Personally, I also tried intermittent fasting for losing weight, and saw 
some weight loss, but I am not still 100% convinced yet whether this method 
is good for keeping overall health conditions very well, because I couldn't 
find a verified medical research output about whether the intermittent 
fasting is really helpful for improving our health.

Once again, intermittent fasting is a very interesting issue in health and
this is pretty much everything that I know about it.
