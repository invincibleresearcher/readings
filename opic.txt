Tell me about the time you bought an electronic device such as 
a cell phone, a computer or a mouse then got disappointed. What 
was the problem? Did you ask a refund?

I remember the time when I replaced my old macbook with the new macbook.
My old macbook had some battery and power issues, so I decided to buy new
one and went to the apple store without checking the detailed specs of lastest 
macbook. After buying new one, I found that the new one had smaller number of 
usb ports than the usb ports in my old laptop, which made me very inconvenient 
when I use USB mouse and attach other external devices to the laptop together.
Because everything looked good except the usb ports in my new laptop, I didn't 
ask refund, but I needed to buy additional usb extender for new macbook.

Hello, I am looking for a new iphone. May I ask a few questions about
the product ? Or, can I speak to someone who can answer my questions ?
I called other stores and they said they don't have latest iphones with 
black color in stock. Do you have latest black iphones in stock ? 
What is the total price of iphone with sixty four giga bytes storage 
including 2 years applecare plan ? I heard that the screen in the latest
iphone is very weak and might be cracked very easily. Does the default applecare 
cover the screen repair ? I heard that the warranty period of the default 
applecare is one year. Can I purchase new applecare plan later after the
default plan expired ? I usually spend four giga bytes for wireless internet.
Can you recommend the best data plan for me ? And how is the price ?
If I bring my old iphone to your store, can you help me to migrate every photos 
and data from old iphone to new one ? Is it free ?

You have received the new phone, but the features are not what you expected. 
Call the store, explain the situation, and give several alternatives to 
handle the problem.

Hello, I bought new galaxy phone last week in your store, but have a 
problem with this product. May I ask you to help me out please ? Or, 
can I speak to someone who can take care of my issue ?

Today, I just turned on my phone in the morning, but after calling three
times during 10 minutes, I found that the phone became very hot and even 
though I killed several apps running as background, I couldn't cool the 
phone down. I just turned it off and let the phone cool down for a while
but after turning on again, such thermal issue still remains.

So, I would like to have a refund for this device. I still have my receipt
for this. Can you share some guideline for this ? Do you also want me to bring
all phone packaging box together with receipt for a refund ? Please tell me
everything I need for a refund. 

If refund is not possible, I would like to replace the galaxy phone with
galaxy note ten. If the price of galaxy note ten is higher than the price
of the galaxy phone that I bought, I don't mind to pay more. Can you check
if this also works in my case ?

If refund or replacement for my phone doesn't work at all, I would like to
inspect my new phone using the phone repair service. Can you check if the
warranty plan that I bought together also covers the cost for this ? Can
you find the nearest phone repair shops from my place ?
