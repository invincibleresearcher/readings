1. Technology has definitely changed over time. Tell me about an early memory
that you have about a piece of technology. It could be a computer or a mobile
phone from many years ago. Describe for me what this thing was like back then.
How has that technology changed over time?

Indeed, science and technology has made remarkable progress over the
years and it's not difficult to see the technological advances in our daily
life. Especially, when I have a look at the computer history and how the
computers have changed from the past, I can say that today's computers are
totally different from the computers used in my childhood.

I first used the computers when I was in the elementary school in 
ninety eighties and the personal computers at that time were very
bulky and the monitor was also very thick. Also, the storage devices
used in such old computers were disks, which made very loud noise when
I tried to read some files on the disk. Also, the operating system at 
that time was dos, which had no graphic user interface at all, and we 
couldn't use mouse and all input to the computers were from the keyboard. 
Also, there was no network devices in the old computers and there was 
no way to communicate with other people using different computers.

Now, my personal computer is macbook laptop pc. Though this laptop is
not for heavy computing workload, but the computing capacity of my current
laptop is much more powerful than the computing capacity of super computer
when I was in the elementary school. Using this laptop, I can play
games while opening web browsers to chat with other people on the net
This was called multithreading and this technique was impossible in my old 
computers.

So, the technical advance in computers is amazing and quite impressive.


2. Problems often come up because of our dependence on technology. Think
about a time when you experienced a problem because some piece of technology
was not working properly. Maybe your computer crashed or maybe your cell
phone had no service. Tell me about a time when you had some kind of problem
getting your technology to work.

As a computer engineer, I cannot live without computers and in
using computers in in my life is almost like breathing as in my case.
So, I always have many problems in my life when I cannot access computers or
when I cannot do my work because my computer crashes. But among all problems
that I have experienced, I would like to share the worst and most serious story 
that I recently experienced using computers.

My father in law has his own business and all documents used in his company including
the contract information with the company's customers and top secret financial documents 
have been stored in just one computer, which is used as a server and everyone in
his company connected their local computers to the server to access those
documents. Everything looked very peaceful before one terrible incident related 
with the computers in his company happened. The sad story started when one of
his employee entered one suspicious web site. Soon after, the malware was
downloaded and made his computer infected, and then the malware spread all
other computers which are connected with the employee's computer online and
the server was also infected. 

After the server got infected by the malware, soon after, all words in the documents 
stored in the server started encrypted and all files got corrupted. When we tried to open 
the corrupted files, the computer showed some pop-up messages like "send file
bit coins to this email address, then we will recover your computer".
My father in law asked me to recover all his computer systems, but after
several tries, I realized that there was no way to recover them except paying
money to the criminals.

So, that was my first experience with bit coin in my life and I could finally recover
all his documents after paying money by trasferring bitcoins to the criminals' bitcoin 
account. After experiencing this disaster caused by malware, I employed some
safe backup method in my father in law's company to prevent future possible
disaster from computer malware.

Once again, I love to use computers and enjoy its technological advance, but
I also learned some lessons from the malware that there is also a bad side when
we are using computers.


3. Which piece of technology do you use most often? Do you use computers or
mobile phones? Tell me about the most typical type of technology you use every
day.
-->
I think that my computers are the devices that I use most often in my life.
When I work in my company, I have to write technical documents using my 
computers and need to connect the company server to see some shared documents 
which are only accessed in special type of network connection. Also, my main job 
is writing computer languages for software to operate complex electronic devices developed
in my company. When writhing computer languages is done, I need to log in
another computer server to build the software again and I need to re-install the software
containing my revision on some embedded computing systems as well. 
You may think the embedded computing systems as small computers embedded
inside electronic products. So, there are many computing devices around me at 
my work place and every computer from servers and embedded computers are
connected on the same network. I think that the network technology makes everything 
connected each other.

After work, when I was home, I enjoy playing games using my computers. My
main computer that I am using home is macbook, but sadly, my favorite computer 
games are only available on window microsoft computers. Is it impossible to play
window games on my macbook ? No, I never gave up to play my favorite games and
my decision is installing a virtual machine software which emulates window 
operating system on my macbook without any performance degradation. So, I 
can now play those games in a virtual microsoft window operating system on
the top of mac operating system. In the past, this was impossible, but due to
the advance of computer virtualization technology, I can run the window programs
in my mac computers or run mac programs in my window computers very easily.

So, I use computer a lot in my life and especially I can get many benefits 
from computer network systems and computer virtualization.
