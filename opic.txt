2. You indicated in the survey that you stay at home for vacations. 
What do people in your country normally do on their vacations? 
How is it different from the way people used to spend vacations 
when you were growing up?

Because there are so many people in my country and each people have
their own wish lists for their vacation activities, it's very hard
to say in just few words what our Koreans normally do on their vacations.
But when I hear about how my friends or colleagues in my company spend
their vacations, I can list up several things which people 
around me commonly do on their vacations. First, they visit well-known
places in Korea with beautiful scenes such as beach areas and beautiful
valleys with a lot of water around some mountains. Also, there are some people 
who do not want to leave their cities for their vacations, but just
enjoy meeting their friends around their home while doing some hobbies
together. Also, for those people whose home town are far away from their
work places, they make vacation plans to visit their home town where 
their parents live. So, these are what our people usually spend 
their vacation today.

I personally don't think that people in my childhood spent vacations
differently, and the way how they spent vacations was almost identical
to what we do during vacations today. For example, people in the past 
also liked to visit the beautiful places for their vacations. 
I can say that there are only few differences for visiting vacation
places between in the past and today. In the past, our people didn't
have high speed train such as KTX so only way to get vacation places 
such as PUSAN was using cars or trains. I remember that it usually 
took more than five hours to arrive at PUSAN from SEOUL. But 
now we still love to visit PUSAN, because of its beautiful beaches,
but it only takes less than 2 hours when I use KTX, high-speed train from 
SEOUL. So, due to the technology advances over years, I can say that 
convenience has been improved a lot regarding vacation activities, 
but still today's people do almost same activities for their vacation
like what people in the past did.
