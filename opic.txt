When I was a child, there was no such a gyms with good facilities which 
today's most of gyms have and people at that time did not use gym facilities
much less frequently than today. Instead, people in my village usually did
their exercises by climbing their local mountains and walking in the local 
parks. I do not know exactly why people in the past in my 
country didn't use gym facilities, but I guess that one of the reasons was
simply because people thought less about their health than today.

In the past, people usually did workout for not being sick and they
considered the regular workout as just walking or jogging regularly in the 
fresh air without any help of gym weight equipment. But now, people have
become a lot more health-conscious than in the past. Due to this trend,
today's gyms have become a lot better in quality than in the past and
people can now not only use various gym weight equipments, but also
can sign up for various exercise classes such as yoga, pilates in the
gyms.

Once again, Today people has been taking much care of being healthy,
but also they do a lot of exercise in the gyms to have an attractive
body shape.
