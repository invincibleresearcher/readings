2. Most people say that travelling has become more difficult in 
the past 5 years. Tell me what types of changes you have observed when 
travelling and how these changes affected the traveler or travel experience.

Personally, I do not agree with the option that travelling has become 
more difficult over the years. I think it is completely opposite and 
travelling has become a lot easier and even cheaper than in the past due 
to the advance of the internet technology and the innovation of service & 
transportation business.

First, transportation is becoming easier and cheaper. Compared to the small
number of airlines we used in the past, the number of low price airlines 
has been increasing a lot and therefore, we can now buy the airplane ticket
a lot cheaper. Also, today, we can use Uber instead of yellow cab and using
Uber, the waiting time is getting shorter and we don't need to pay expensive
taxi fare anymore. Also, the hotel & inn reservation becomes a lot easier 
since there are a lot of mobile apps for the reservation and everything 
about room selection and payment is done by just few clicks in the apps.

Also, there are great navigation apps in our phones and using them together 
with some information from the travel review web sites, we would not fail
anymore for finding the best places for travelling.

Once again, I don't think that the travelling has become more difficult
over the years, but become a lot easier and cheaper.
