1. Can you tell me all about the things you do in order
to prepare for trips?

Because I always love to travel with my family, there are a lot of things 
to be checked carefully when we prepare for travelling.
First thing I usually do for a trip preparation is to check whether all
reservations are done correctly and there is no additional charge on 
our reservations when we arrive at the trip places.
For example, the reservation which should be done in advance includes 
the hotel room, the car rent, the restaurants where we plan to eat during 
our travel and some entrance permit for local museum and local parks.
Personally, I do not enjoy going to a museum, but 
for education purpose, I always consider which museums are good for my
children during our visit on the trip places.

Also, I am not a heavy packer when I travel alone, but I need to pack tons 
of things for my children when I prepare for a family trip. First, I have
to make sure to put all the clothes and underwears my kids use in a
luggage. Then, I pack some some emergency medicine or a first-aid kit, 
sun creams preventing sun burns, sunglasses and some extra jackets for 
my children. For foods, I usually prefer to use local restaurants and 
I do not pack foods much which our family eat during a trip.

I always use my car for trips in my country and so I visit mechanics 
and get my car inspected when I prepare for my travel. Also, using wearable 
devices such as tablets and GPS enabled mobile phones is a must during 
travelling. So, I never forget to check all devices working correctly and 
to check whether I can use wifi for free.

Once again, I need to prepare a lot of things together before travelling.
