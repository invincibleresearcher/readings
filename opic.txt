1. Where do people in your country go to when they travel abroad? Why do they
like visiting those locations? What is special about the countries they visit?
-->
I heard from news that Japan is the most visited country by Koreans for 
oversea travels, though there are still some political tensions between Japan and 
our country. Personally, I have never been to Japan for travel, but I think
that Japan is very attractive country for travel and I would like to travel to Japan 
if I have free time in near future.

First, Japan is our neighbor country and it doesn't take much time to visit
Japan and the airplane tickets are not expensive for visiting some of major 
cities in Japan such as Osaka and Toyko. For example, it only takes less than 2 hours 
to get the Tokyo international airport from the inchon airport and the 
round trip airplane ticket only costs around five hundred dollars or 
fifty thousand won.

Also, there are various spa resorts in Japan and those resorts looks very 
exotic to foreigners. Some people may think that The cost of using spa
facilities in Japan is expensive, but if we consider that the reservation for 
spa resorts usually include everything from the hotel room, the spa voucher
and all meals from breakfast to dinner, we cannot say that the total cost during 
the visit in Japan spa resorts is not expensive compare to the total expense 
of domestic trips in Korea.

Also, I think that Japanese foods are very yummy and some Koreans travel to Japan 
only for Japanese foods. Sushi and rolls are also favorite foods for Koreans.
Especially, tuna sushi in Japan is the best all over the world and some Koreans
also love to visit such top rated sushi restaurants though the price is very 
expensive.

Once again, Korean travel to Japan the most, because the travel expense is 
relatively cheaper than other countries, but also people can enjoy various spa resorts 
and wonderful foods in Japan at the same time.


2. When people discuss traveling to other countries, what are the things that they
are most interested in doing or seeing? Why are these things of such interest or
importance to travelers?
-->
For topics which people discuss the most about traveling to other countries, 
I guess that foods which people are eating during travel is the most commonly 
mentioned topic among travellers.

First, I think that it is simply just great fun to try to eat different 
foods at some exotic places and decent restaurants in a different country.
In my case, I personally had a lot of chances to eat various international foods 
, chinese, thailand, indian, Caribbean, greece and etc, when I stayed in Ann Arbor, Michigan, 
where a lot of multi-national students live for their studies and so many international 
restaurants do their business. But the problems that I had for those foods are 
that almost all foods are americanized and I couldn't taste their original tastes in 
the restaurants when I studied there.  So, when I have chances to travel overseas, 
I always try to find the best local restaurants where I can enjoy the original flavors 
of the authentic foods that I ate before as a version of american foods.

Also, food hygiene is also very important problem to those people who 
go to other countries for their travel, because they do not want to get 
poisoned during their travel. So, sharing the information of the local restaurants 
where we can eat foods safely is very common for travellers. So, before
leaving for travel, we commonly check the reviews about the local restaurants 
in google maps, facebooks or in some web sites for travelers.

Once again, I think that people discuss foods the most about travelling 
to other countries and I also enjoy talking about the foods that I eat 
during my travel.


3. When people talk about travelling, what are the main issues or concerns
they typically raise or discuss? What has caused these concerns? What is being 
done to address these concerns for the future?
-->
I think that the safety is one of the biggest main concerns for travels.
Recently, I heard a lot of serious crimes which targeted the travellers in
other countries. One of the shocking news that I heard most was the news about
the murders which took place in thailand. In such cases, the criminals first
approached the travellers friendly to teach how to get the hotels, but soon 
after they took the travellers as hostage and demanded ransome to the traveller's
government and family, and eventually killed them.

So, in my case, because I usually travel with my family including my two kids, 
I try to do everything I can do for my family safety when we travel to other 
countries. For family safety during the travel, I first do not leave any 
posting and any photo in my SNS account such as facebook and twitter, 
because maybe criminals might find useful information for us if they try to
target us as their crimes. If you watch movie series, taken 1, 2, 3, you may know 
how easily criminals finds our information for their crimes.
Also, I always reserve more than 4 or 5 star hotel rooms for my family travel.
It's very expensive to stay such hotel, but because I think that safety is much 
more important than the money, I don't mind spending money on safety. Also,
we do not use any other transportation on our trips, but the taxies and limousines 
which the hotel we stay manage for its customers. There might be a lot of 
risks from meeting strangers while using public transportation and I think I 
can reduce such risks by only using guaranteed transportation services 
during our travel.

Once again, I believe that the safety is the biggest concern for travellers
and I also take care of the travel safety a lot when I go to other countries
with my family.
