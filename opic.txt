1. Warm-up
Tell me how the things you and your friends talk about 
have changed. What did you talk about when you were young? 
What do you talk about now?
-->
When we were young, we talked a lot about how to develop our future
careers and which companies or graduate universities we should go for
developing our future careers. But today, our main topics changes and
we usually have a conversation on how to make money such as investment,
real estates and stock. We also have a conversation on political issues
in our country.
